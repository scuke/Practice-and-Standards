Cybersecurity Standards

	In the world of cybersecurity you can never be too safe with constantly evolving threats there will always be a role for security experts. Security specialists have to adapt to the changes of technology to stay on top of these threats and new tech shapes the way we 
 
 design our frameworks and standards.
 
  New technology presents opportunities and issues for cybersecurity. Quantum computing is a phrase you'll hear a lot because it has the potential to be destructive if it ever becomes more accessible to the public. It would render our encryption and passwords useless due 
  
to how fast it computes. According to KPMG "Quantum computers can break encryption methods at an alarming speed, rendering ineffective encryption tools that are widely used today to protect everything from banking and retail transactions to business data, documents, email 

and more." lf this technology became more streamlined cyber security professionals would have to change everything to protect against quantum computing. There is also the use of AI, which can be bad or good. On the good side of things, AI can be used to change detection 

and response using advanced learning, getting rid of those false positives and showing more real detections. Alternatively, attackers can use AI to launch attacks and develop malware. Organizations such as NIST are already working on standards for quantum computing 

events, which shows how important this is to cyber professionals.
 
  With the use of technology there are standards to follow that protect an organization and the information they hold. leading organizations like NIST and ISO have widely adopted frameworks. They provide best practices and guidelines to help organizations manage and 
  
reduce cyber risks. IT professionals follow standards that include password policies to reduce the risk of weak passwords. ZenGRC contributes to this statement saying "A strong cybersecurity framework can provide excellent guidance as you work through the layers of risk 

assessment."
 
  These frameworks can also be used to do a security audit. A security audit is an evaluation of a company's systems to see how well it meets established criteria. TechTarget also says " A thorough audit typically assesses the security of the system's physical 
  
configuration and environment, software, information handling processes, and user practices." An auditor typically will run scans on a system and report back to the company with their findings and workarounds. They can be used to determine compliance with regulations. 

They construct security plans and risk assessments. Audits will identify vulnerabilities and other issues. How often an audit is needed depends on the kind of business and the risks involved. It is common practice to do security audits yearly if not more frequently.
